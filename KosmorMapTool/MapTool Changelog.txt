v2.00 (31.08.2012)

New/changed feature:

	- The map tool will now create an .xml file with the planets of each run. These xml filesa re for the newly created Planet Tool (seperate program).
	- Disabled writing neutral planets to the .html for now, until i add an additional option to seperate writing to html and to the .xml
	- Rearranged some code, has no impact on the tool itself


v1.96 (28.02.2012)

New/changed feature:

	- The map tool will now store all created csv files in a csv subfolder, just like the maps and the html files, instead of overwritting the daily one.
	  It will no longer keep a special "today.csv", however.

v1.95 (03.02.2012)

Fixed bugs:

	- Fixed a bug with with the kosmor leap year recognition. Not sure if it is really fixed, but it's working for now.

v1.94 (23.12.2011)

Fixed bugs:

	- Fixed a bug that lead to .svg files having "null" instead of the actual Kosmor Date in the file name.

v1.93 (11.12.2011)

Fixed bugs:

	- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.92 that lead to the map tool treating warplanets as normal planets.

v1.92 (10.12.2011)

New Features:

	- It's now possible to generate a .csv file with the planets/warplanets
	  As always, there is a simple entry in the settings available, csv=true/false
	  The .csv file is called "today.csv" and will be loocated in the local directory, 
	  like everything else.

v1.91 (28.09.2011)

New Features:

	- The map tool now features two new columns. The second to last is used to select a warplanet or planet, 
	  the last one will then display the distance of every warplanet/planet from the selected planet.
	  
	  Note: Without fetchInfo, all coordinates will rounded to the nearest integer due to the svg only using integer values
	  		With fetchInfo, all coordinates use exactly one decimal place, reflecting the actual usage in Kosmor
	  		
	  		Exception: The links back to Kosmor use the same precision as "set waypoint". Only warplanets actually have decimal places though.
	  
	  Note: There can be rounding errors due to the way computers and JavaScript in particular handle (floating point) numbers. 
	  
	  Examples and explanations for the interested:

v1.90 (10.09.2011)

New Features:

	- The map tool will now write down the distance a WP traveled this turn.
	
	- Using the new radio buttons in front of each row, it is now possible to display the distance between
	  up to 3 different objects. Many thanks to alphabravo for this one.
	  
Fixed issues:

	 - The sorting should now better reflect the natural order of the elements. Previously, 802 was smaller then 85 and similar.  
	  
Known issues:

	- Sometimes, the map tool will link to another entry in Mephas Online Kosmor Tools as one would expect.
	  In cases like Asgard, this is a problem within the Online Kosmor Tools, as it does actually feature two entries for this house,
	  both being the same, but one containing only a limited time period, which actually is missing from the main entry.
	  
	  It's most likely not possible to fix it on this side, at least not in a sensible way. Currently, there are no other known
	  issues with this feature. If you find something, you know where to find me.

	
v1.87 (04.09.2011)

Fixed bugs:
	
	- The map tool will no longer crash if it can't connect to Mephas Online Kosmor Tools. Instead, it will simply not write the links.


v1.86 (01.09.2011)

New Features:

	- The columns with player and house name will now link to the according profile at Mephas Online Kosmor Tools ( http://kosmor.ath.cx )
	  As it is possible that a house is not listed in there when no player ever did something that got reported in the house with this house name,
	  like someone never did conquer anything while independent, only while in another house, (see Ty for example), not every house will feature
	  a link.
	  
	  This feature is only used if you use fetchInfo, as otherwise there is no house or player info available.


v1.85 (30.08.2011)

Fixed bugs: 
	- Fixed a bug that made the tool list planets (with owners) as neutral when they are close to a neutral planet.
	  This bug was (most likely) introduced with Version 1.83
	
Known issues:

	- See 1.83. No new issues known.	
	
	
v1.84 (28.08.2011)

New Features:

	- Enabled alternating coloring of the rows to ease the handling of the table
	
	- The tool will now show the changelog before you have to decide whether you want to download the new version if you set it to "ask".
	
Known issues:

	- See 1.83. No new issues known.


v1.83 (18.08.2011)

New Features:

	- If fetchinfo is set, the map tool will now also calculate the combat power of any fleet it does find and write it to the html, instead of only
	  displaying whether a planet/warplanet does have ships or not. The later is still used when fetchinfo is not set.
	  
	- You can now set "checkforupdate" to off, ask, info, download or all.
		- off does mean that the tool will not bother you with anything. You will have to check yourself if there is a new version etc.
		- ask does mean, that the map tool will ask you if you want to view the changelog and if you want to download the new version each time
		- info does mean it will open the changelog, but not download the tool. It will proceed to run with the "old" version.
		- download: It will download the new version and exit. It will not show the changelog, and you will have to run it again yourself
		- all: It will both open the changelog, and download the new version. It will exit itself, and you will have to run it yourself again, too.
		
		The configuration tool is not yet updated. Will follow some time.
	  
Known issues:

	from v1.80:

	- The option to get the house name from Kosmor will always reflect the current status in Kosmor. House affiliation may have changed
	  or you might not even see some planets anymore. House names *will* be overwritten, either with the current owner or left blank.
	  
	- If the option to update old files is set, but no compatible files are found in the current directory, the map tool will
	  just show a blank screen and exit after 10 seconds instead of notifying the user of the problem.
	  
	- If you run the map tool before the daily turn happened, it will set both date and turn correct, but it will create a new file
	  even if there is already one for this turn, as the day is now 08.08. instead of 07.08. It should notice if a file for this turn
	  and either abort, delete the old file or ask the user what to do.


v1.82 (12.08.2011)

New Features:

	- The map tool can now update itself. Simply set "checkforupdates" in the settings or as startup parameter and it will check
	  if there is a new version and, if available, download it. The map tool does exit automatically, but it does not restart itself.
	  Note that the configuration tool will NOT update itself.
	  
Known issues:

	from v1.80:

	- The option to get the house name from Kosmor will always reflect the current status in Kosmor. House affiliation may have changed
	  or you might not even see some planets anymore. House names *will* be overwritten, either with the current owner or left blank.

	  even if there is already one for this turn, as the day is now 08.08. instead of 07.08. It should notice if a file for this turn
	  and either abort, delete the old file or ask the user what to do.


v1.81 (11.08.2011)

New Features:

	- The .html files now allow filtering and offer autocomplete for the first column.
	
	- Renamed fetchhouse to fetchinfo, as it is now looking for the player name, too. Updated the configuration tool accordingly

	- The html files now do import the needed file(s) for the sorting and filtering. Place them in the same directory as the map tool itself.

Known issues:

	from v1.80:

	- The option to get the house name from Kosmor will always reflect the current status in Kosmor. House affiliation may have changed
	  or you might not even see some planets anymore. House names *will* be overwritten, either with the current owner or left blank.

	  and either abort, delete the old file or ask the user what to do.

	
v1.80 (08.08.2011)

New Features:

	- It is now possible to update any amount of old .html files. Copy the old maps in the local directory as you would do with a new map, 
	  set the update option to true and start it. It will now work on the files on at the time, but automatically start with the next one.
	 
	  Note: Can take quite long to finish if updating several files and using the option to fetch the house names. If the map tool is closed
	  while still working, you might end up with a half finished .html. Maps already finished with or not yet started are not affected in any way.
	  
	- Changed the output to the .html files to make them less clustered.
	
	- The .html files are now sortable. Javascript has to be enabled.
	
 	- If the map tool does not find Lymgat, it will ask to input a planet to use instead to calculate the coordinates. This is needed because the coordinates
 	  in the .svg are not the same as the Kosmor ones and do change based on your map

Fixed bugs:

	- from v1.20
	
 	  The map tool no longer writes a planet "Maelstroem" with the coordinates 9/-16 at the end of the planet list.

Changed behaviour:

	- As the old method of using colors was not reliable enough, the map tool will now drop the house name completely from the .html if 
	  the option to get it from Kosmor is not used. 
	
Known issues:

	- The option to get the house name from Kosmor will always reflect the current status in Kosmor. House affiliation may have changed
	  or you might not even see some planets anymore. House names *will* be overwritten, either with the current owner or left blank.
	  
	- If the option to update old files is set, but no compatible files are found in the current directory, the map tool will

	  even if there is already one for this turn, as the day is now 08.08. instead of 07.08. It should notice if a file for this turn
	  and either abort, delete the old file or ask the user what to do.

v1.71 (31.07.2011)

Fixed issues:
	
	- The configuration tool now does reflect the latest changes (GUI, update). It also finally includes an option to set a custom date.
	  The map tool will now make use of it if set, whether you start it with GUI or not, or if you used the settings or the startup parameters.
	  Remember to not only input the date, but also the hour, e.g "30.10.2010 10". The hour is important to determine if the daily turn already happened.
	
	- Cleaned up and restructured some code.
	
	- Decided to no longer list the color issue/bug. It is not possible to fix it using colors, so it would just clutter up the changelog
	
Possible future features:

	- Updating all old html files, instead of only one
	
	- Redesign of the output to make it less clustered.
	
	- Use of a checkbox for the custom date dialog instead of inputting the hour.	 

1.70 (30.07.2011)

New Features:

	- It's now possible to decide if you want to use the console version or the GUI version. Both use the settings.ini first if supplied, if not
	  they check for startup parameters. 
	 
	- To support this, there is a new startup parameter "-gui". You can also set it in the .ini, so "gui=true" or "gui=false". You can switch at any time.
	
	- Introducing an update parameter, "-update" for the non-GUI, "update=true" (or false) for the GUI. 
	  Using this the map tool checks the local directory  for maps named in the format "179_3507(31.07.2011) - Planet & WP List - kosmor.com - .svg", 
	  which is how they are named by the tool itself. If it does find one, it will use this instead of the draw_map_svg, and use the date mentioned
	  in the file name as date for everything. This is part of an effort to make it easier to update the .html files generated by previous versions.
	  
	- It will now show the version either in the title bar (if using the GUI) or print a message which version you are using. 
      It will also write the version into the .html file
      
    - Removed the "-" from the settings. It's now "warplanets=true" or "fetchhouse=false" instead of "-warplanets=true". Originally introduced to allow for
      backwards compatibility with the startup parameters, it turned out to be totally seperated anyways. Startup parameters still use the "-". 
      
    - Renamed "fetchHouses" to "fetchhouse" for consistency 
      
Known bugs

	from v1.1/1.60:
	
	- When using colors instead of fetching the house names from Kosmor, the owner of a planet with a specific color is always 
	  the last warplanet found with the same color, or who's first or second darker color is the same color as the planet
	  
Known issues:

	from 1.70:
	
	- The configuration tool does not yet reflect the changes regarding GUI or updating old files. You can still set it in the settings yourself. 
	  All other changes should be included

	from 1.50/1.60:
	
	- There is not yet an option to use a custom date instead of the current date when using the GUI. It is still possible to do so with the old method, but
	  the map tool will only check the startup parameters when no settings.ini is found. 

	from 1.1/1.60	  
	
	- Different houses can have the same color, now way to differentiate. Not an issue when fetching house names directly
	  from Kosmor, but when using the old (and faster, though it ends up wrong for most planets) method	of determining it by colors		
	
v1.60 (28.07.2011)

New Features:

    - Replaced most output to the console with status messages written to the new GUI, which includes a timestamp for each message.
     
    - Introducing the option to fetch housenames directly from Kosmor, which is 100% accurate and possible for all visible planets. The downside is, that it does take
      quite long for a huge amount of planets. 1 second for 5-10 planets, ~8 minutes for 4000 planets. The tool will show you which planet it is currently fetching out of
      how many as well as a percentage.
      
     - Updated the configuration tool accordingly.

v1.51 (27.07.2011)

New Features:

    - The map tool will now ask for username and password via a message dialog, not via the console, so you can start it directly 
     (not using console/bat) without having to permanently save username and password in the settings
     
    - It will now check if it could connect with the given username and password. If not, it will show an error dialog and exit.
      
Known bugs

	from v1.1:
	
	- The owner of a planet with a specific color is always the last warplanet found with the same color, or who's
  	  first or second darker color is the same color as the planet
	- Different houses can have the same color, now way to differentiate.		
	
v1.50 (26.07.2011)

New Features:

    - Introducing the Kosmor Map Tool Configuration Tool, it's now possible to use a settings file ("settings.ini") to configure what will be written 
      to the .html file as well as to determine the login data. It is still possible to use the previous method of attaching the info as startup parameters.
      
      
Known bugs

	from v1.10:
	
	- The owner of a planet with a specific color is always the last warplanet found with the same color, or who's
  	  first or second darker color is the same color as the planet
	- Different houses can have the same color, now way to differentiate.		
	
v1.43 (20.07.2011)

New Features:

    - It now converts all times to GMT/UTC before processing, to avoid problems with people using it in different timezones etc., 
      especially regarding the fixed bug below and similar.
      

Fixed bugs:
	
	- (Hopefully) fixed a bug where if you would run the tool before the turn happend, it would actually think it's a turn earlier.
	  Example: It's 7:00. Current turn: 168. Next turn: 169. If you run it, it would write 167, instead of 168.
	  If you ran it after the turn happend, like at 15:00, everything was alright, but not between 0:00 and the next turn.

Known bugs:


	from v1.10:
	
	- The owner of a planet with a specific color is always the last warplanet found with the same color, or who's
  	  first or second darker color is the same color as the planet
	- Different houses can have the same color, now way to differentiate.	
	
v1.42 (20.07.2011)

Fixed bugs:
	
	- Fixed a bug where it would not correctly create the folders on Linux systems
	- Fixed a bug where the URL linking to the planets was not correct

Known bugs:
	
	from v1.00
	
	- If you ran the tool between 0:00 and 10:00, where it would simulate the next turn,
	  it would not increase the turn counter accurately, and therefore actually use the wrong turn.	

	from v1.10:
	
	- The owner of a planet with a specific color is always the last warplanet found with the same color, or who's
  	  first or second darker color is the same color as the planet
	- Different houses can have the same color, now way to differentiate.		
	
v1.41 (07.07.2011)

Fixed bugs:

	- Fixed a bug where it would not correctly login to Kosmor despite starting it with the -login and -password parameter

Known bugs:

	from v1.10:
	
	- The owner of a planet with a specific color is always the last warplanet found with the same color, or who's
  	  first or second darker color is the same color as the planet
	- Different houses can have the same color, now way to differentiate.	
	
v1.40 (24.06.2011)

New Features:
	
	 - If the map is not found in the local directory, now downloads it from Kosmor.
	   As it does need the login data to do so, it is now possible to use "-login abdce" and "-password xyz" as start up parameter.
	   If these are not given, it will ask for the login data later before downloading.
	   
	 - It now writes "ships" when there are ships on a planet/warplanet. If not, nothing has changed. 

Other stuff: 

	 - Cleaned up some code, no longer calling each and every method with the whole "String[] args", but extracting the parameters
	   right after start up, and calling the methods with whatever they need. Also documented and commented the new HTTPClient and some
	   other methods

Known bugs:

	from v1.10:
	
	- The owner of a planet with a specific color is always the last warplanet found with the same color, or who's
  	  first or second darker color is the same color as the planet
	- Different houses can have the same color, now way to differentiate.		
	
v1.31 (21.06.2011)

New Features:
	
	 - The real date as well as the kosmor date are now written on the top of the html, too.

Known bugs:

	from v1.10:

v1.30 (18.06.2011)

New Features:

	- Implemented new startup parameter, -date
	  Setting -date always to input a date of your own, format "dd.mm.yyyy" (18.06.2011)
	  Instead of todays date, this date will be used for everything.
	  Changing the system date is no longer required this way

	- Renamed the directory for the .svg files from map to svg
	- Introduced checks to find out wether the html and svg directories do exists and if they are directories, if not, they are created

Fixed Bugs:

	from v1.00
